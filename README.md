# RugbyScoreCounter

This is my *RugbyScoreCounter* app, issued from the following Udacity's course : ***Android Basics : User Input***

Project 2 : Build a Score Keeper App

Due to a lack of imagination, I wrote the code basing myself on my *CourtCounter* app : therefore, functionnalities and design are quite similar on both apps.
### Code review

I did my best to follow the project specification, but my code has not been reviewed.

The project was tested on my phone.

### Functionnalities
- designed for **Rugby** games
- press on scoring buttons to increase the score of each team
- press on the *reset* button to reset scores (0 - 0)
